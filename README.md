# Apple-Global-Sales-Analysis-Python-Excel-Dashboard
## Project Summary
This project analyzes global Apple product sales using a dataset from Kaggle. I used Python (Pandas) to merge multiple tables into a unified dataset and Excel for data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard creation. The goal was to extract insights on product performance, geographic sales patterns, and yearly/monthly trends.
